# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing an AI-powered stock trading bot specifically designed for the Russian stock market (MOEX). The system will analyze Russian market data, news from Russian financial sources, and execute trades with Russian stocks. The bot will build upon the concepts from the ChatGPT Micro-Cap Experiment but will be adapted for the Russian market specifics, including local regulations, trading hours, currency considerations, and Russian-language news analysis.

The bot will serve as an intelligent trading assistant that can analyze vast amounts of Russian market data, identify trading opportunities in Russian stocks, and execute trades based on predefined strategies and risk management rules tailored to the Russian market environment.
