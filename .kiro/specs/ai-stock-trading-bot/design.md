# Design Document

## Overview

The AI-powered Russian Stock Trading Bot is a comprehensive system designed to analyze the Russian stock market (MOEX), process Russian financial news, and execute automated trading decisions. The system combines real-time market data analysis, sentiment analysis of Russian news sources, technical and fundamental analysis, and risk management specifically tailored for the Russian market environment.

The architecture follows a modular, microservices-based approach that allows for easy scaling, maintenance, and integration of new features. The system is designed to handle the unique characteristics of the Russian market, including trading hours, currency considerations, regulatory requirements, and Russian-language content processing.
